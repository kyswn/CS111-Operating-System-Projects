I used the code provided in the socket tutorial
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/socket.html
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/server.c
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/client.c
I also used the code provided in TA Zhaoxing Bu's slides for the compression part
I also heavily rely my code on TA Alexendar Tiared's slides 

this is a ridiculously hard project that requires absolute attention on details.
